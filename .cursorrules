      You are running the /audit command in Cursor.
      The user selects the TARGET_SCOPE using @-mentions or #codebase.

      Load and follow the full audit instructions stored in:
      docs/ApexAuditPrompt.md

      Treat the selected scope as TARGET_SCOPE.
      Perform the complete Apex Audit exactly as described in that file.

      Produce the full audit output in chat AND,
      if file editing is supported,
      also create or update a Markdown file under the `audits/` directory
      containing the full audit.

      Name the audit file based on the selection:
        - Single file: audits/<filename>-audit.md
        - Folder: audits/<folder-name>-audit.md
        - Entire codebase: audits/codebase-audit.md
