# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 2025**

## Overview

BetTracker is a privacy-first application. All your betting data stays on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your information on external servers.

## Data Storage

BetTracker stores all your betting data locally in your browser using localStorage. This means:

- Your data never leaves your device
- No servers receive your information
- No accounts or sign-ups required
- No data is shared with third parties

## What We Store Locally

When you use BetTracker, the following information is stored in your browser's localStorage:

- Bet information you import (stakes, odds, outcomes, bet types)
- Your application settings and preferences
- Parsing history to prevent duplicate imports
- Custom filters and views you create

## Your Data Control

You have complete control over your data:

- **Export:** Download all your data as a JSON backup file anytime (Settings → Export Backup)
- **Delete:** Remove all data from your browser instantly (Settings → Clear All Data)
- **Access:** Your data is stored in plain text in localStorage and can be viewed using browser developer tools

## No Tracking or Analytics

BetTracker does not use:

- Analytics services (no Google Analytics, no tracking pixels)
- Telemetry or usage monitoring
- Cookies for tracking purposes
- Error reporting services that transmit data

## Third-Party Data Sources

When you import betting data:

- You manually paste HTML or upload CSV files
- This data is processed entirely in your browser
- No data is sent to any external service during parsing
- The original HTML/CSV is not retained after parsing

## Data Security

Since all data is local:

- Use your browser's security features (strong passwords, device encryption)
- Regular backups are recommended (use the Export feature)
- Clearing browser data will delete your BetTracker data
- Private/Incognito mode data is cleared when the window closes

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy occasionally. Any changes will be posted in this file with an updated "Last Updated" date.
